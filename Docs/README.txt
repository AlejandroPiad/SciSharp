SciSharp - Scientific Computing for .NET
========================================

SciSharp is a set of libraries and tools for .NET 4 tailored for
scientific computing. It includes one main library (SciSharp.dll)
with the core API, a few smaller libraries which provide alternative
implementations that might not work on your system (for instance,
GPU acceleration), a few utilities and a lot of examples.

SciSharp is a work in progress, and it is still in a very unstable
state, so use it at your own risk. So said, we think it does
contain some helpful and mostly working tools for scientific 
computing applications that may be of interest both for researchers
in academic areas and for developers who want to spice their software
with a bit of extra magic.

It currently encompasses the following areas:

 * Algorithms on graphs, trees and other collections
 * Language Processing
 * Machine Learning
 * Numerical Optimization (exact and heuristic) 
 * Statistics and Probabilities
 * Simulation
